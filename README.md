## Projects

### I-Conversion Rate


In today's competitive market, optimizing conversion rates is crucial for business growth. Analyzing user data from websites provides insights into conversion mechanisms and helps develop effective strategies. The "Convertion" project focuses on creating a robust prediction model to classify users based on their likelihood of conversion. This classification aids in directing marketing efforts and enhancing user experience to maximize conversions and revenue.

#### Problem Statement
The key challenge is to build an accurate and reliable prediction model that classifies users based on their conversion propensity. This model is essential for guiding marketing strategies and improving user experiences to boost conversion rates and revenue.

#### Proposed Solution
The project utilizes advanced techniques like logistic regression to develop a conversion prediction model. By meticulously preparing data, selecting relevant variables, constructing the model, and evaluating its performance, we aim to provide precise predictive tools for optimizing marketing campaigns and conversion strategies.

#### Objectives
- Predict conversion rates.
- Offer recommendations to the product and marketing teams to enhance conversion rates.

#### Methodology
Our methodology centers around logistic regression, a proven statistical technique for modeling binary outcomes. Using available data, we will build a predictive model to accurately determine whether a user is likely to convert on the website. This model will guide the identification of key conversion factors and inform strategic decisions for the marketing team.

### Poverty Classification

In a socio-economic context where combating poverty is a priority, the ability to identify and classify households affected by this condition remains crucial. The permanent survey on household living conditions (EPCVM) in Mauritania, particularly the data collected for the year 2019-2020, offers a valuable opportunity to explore and understand the correlations between socio-demographic characteristics and household consumption expenditures, as well as their link to poverty status.

#### Problem Statement

The main challenge is to develop an accurate and reliable model capable of classifying households as poor or non-poor based on socio-demographic variables and consumption expenditure data. This classification is essential for developing targeted policies aimed at efficiently allocating resources and social assistance programs.

#### Proposed Solution

This machine learning project aims to develop a robust classification model using logistic regression techniques to predict the poverty status of households based on EPCVM data. By following the standard steps of a machine learning project, including data preparation, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and result interpretation, we aim to create a reliable tool to identify households in poverty.

#### Methodology

The primary methodology for this project will rely on the use of logistic regression, a suitable method for binary classification. Using this approach, we will build a statistical model to accurately predict whether a household is poor or non-poor based on the available variables in the EPCVM data.
